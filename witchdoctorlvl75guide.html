                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Armada Mage's Hat:</strong> You can get this hat from Bishop Queen, located in the West Wing dungeon from Valencia Part 3. You will need to have completed all story content to access this dungeon (Valencia -> Florenza -> Trianon -> Ballroom -> West Wing). You can get to Trianon from a chest in Florenza docks in Valencia, which you can transportalate to. This hat comes with readied spell, which is important to reach readied spell 5. It also comes with a great big guns power, which is good for witchdoctor, whose base kit lacks an aoe dps power that has infinite range and ignores line of sight restrictions. The stats are also great.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Captain Blood's Obsidian Jacket:</strong> You can get the obsidian blood jacket from the Obsidian Blood fight, which you can find in the Scrimshaw Docks at a roomless door with a sigil. Inside will be several obsidian key unlockable fights; you are looking for the one with Captain Blood next to it (Skull Island -> Scrimshaw Docks -> Nightmare Captain Blood Room). This robe is good because of the power, blood flames, which sets 5 fires in a pattern that deal high damage to any enemy that ends up next to them.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Underworld Warlord's Boots:</strong> You can get these boots from fighting Klaw the Merciless in the Temple of the Flaming Skull (Skull Island -> Tunnels of Darkness -> Temple of the Flaming Skull). You can find the Tunnels of Darkness in Blood Shoals, in the cave through the ancient door. You will need to have completed up to a certain point in Sinbad Part 3 to access this dungeon. These boots are important because they provide good stats. The accuracy is especially important because it helps with hitting your readied spell 5. It provides another copy of an aoe heal privateer already has, which can be nice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Armada Mage's Shoes:</strong> You can get these boots from Bishop Queen, located in the West Wing dungeon from Valencia Part 3. You will need to have completed all story content to access this dungeon (Valencia -> Florenza -> Trianon -> Ballroom -> West Wing). You can get to Trianon from a chest in Florenza docks in Valencia, which you can transportalate to. These boots are good because of the power it gives, which is a decent damaging aoe power but it crucially cripples enemy movement, making melee enemies struggle to reach you. The stats are also all helpful to witchdoctors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hawkate's Underworld Boots:</strong> You can get these boots from General Arganon in the Tomb of General Arganon (Aquila -> Achaea -> The Tomb of General Arganon). You will need to have completed the Tartarus questline up to a certain point to access this dungeon. These boots are good because of the eagle eyes, which helps up to 3 companions and/or allies next to you by giving them +1 range.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stheno's Staff:</strong> You can get this staff from the Beast in the Temple of Longing in Tartarus (Aquila -> Delphos -> Tartarus -> Temple of Longing). You must solve the puzzle wrong to spawn the Beast. You can also get this staff by defeating 200 ophidian shades scattered throughout Tartarus and acquiring the badge, Snakes in this Plane!, then buying the staff from the crowns shop. This staff is good because it has the longest range possible at 6. It also has a good power that summons a gorgon that you can mojo buff and will buff that comes with a great aoe heal, mojo-scaling bleed assassin's strike, as well as excellent stats and epics.</li>

                    <li><strong>Patch of St. Rex:</strong> You can get this accessory from the Crowns Shop. It gives 3 great stats for witchdoctor with dodge, accuracy, and mojo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mask of Death:</strong> You can get this accessory from The Wild Hunter in the House of the Faun (Aquila -> Delphos -> Tartarus -> House of the Faun). It gives 2 interesting and helpful epics. One summons ghost minions when you slay an enemy, which have low stats but can still deal chip damage and take aggro. The other will drain health from ANY adjacent unit whenever you are below half health and have been hit, but only once each round. This does scale with your mojo, which can make it potent and a great survival tool for your pirate, but be warned that you can cause the death of your own allies with this epic if you are unlucky and it drains them.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Queen's Vigilant Piece:</strong> You get this totem from Tybalt, a field boss in Trianon from Valencia Part 3. You will need to have completed all story content to access this fight. You can get to Trianon from a chest in Florenza docks in Valencia, which you can transportalate to. This totem is good for the readied spell to contribute to reaching readied spell 5. The spell summons a helpful spell-casting minion, but it only has 1 health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sinbad's Gold Trinket:</strong> You can get this accessory from various battles in the Tamagayoki Tower (Mooshu -> Ravaged Valley -> Tamagayoki Tower). You will need to have completed the sinbad part 1 and 2 questlines to access this tower. This totem is good for the readied spell to reach readied spell 5 as well. The power is good for high single target damage if an enemy is next to you. For witchdoctor, the power is less helpful, as witchdoctor already has a copy of this power. This totem doesn't give health like the other totem, but it is still a very strong option.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content2">
                <h2 class="section-header">Charm</h2>

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clasp of the Mourning Queen:</strong> You get this charm from Margherita, a field boss in Trianon from Valencia Part 3. You will need to have completed all story content to access this fight. You can get to Trianon from a chest in Florenza docks in Valencia, which you can transportalate to. This item is good because it provides two potent defensive powers, one that heals, and one that negates a certain amount of damage on the selected target. This is so good for witchdoctor because it covers for its lack of defensive powers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jade Fleet Charm:</strong> You can get this charm from many places throughout Mooshu. You can get it from Lo Pan in the Temple of the West Wind dungeon (Mooshu -> Subata Skyway -> Icy Dock -> The Paths of Penance -> Temple of the West Wind -> Temple of the West Wind). You can get it from Fire Guardian and Water Guardian in their respective Fire and Water Temple dungeons in Maruzame Castle (Mooshu -> Subata Skyway -> Maruzame Castle -> Fire/Water Temple). You can also get this charm from Timur Khan, an enemy on a ship in Subata Skyway (Mooshu -> Subata Skyway). This charm is good because it provides a copy of the power, big guns, which gives witchdoctor an option for attack when they lack line of sight or range. I recommend using this over the other charm when the enemies you fight are often out of range or there are obstacles on the battlefield that block line of sight.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gorgon's Petrified Band:</strong> You can get this from Chief Brogos in the Cave of Furstrygoneans in Achaea (Aquila -> Achaea -> Cave of Furstrygoneans). You will need to have reached this dungeon in the Tartarus questline to access it. Unfortunately, this dungeon can become inaccessible after completing the story quest that leads to this dungeon. To farm it, use a character that can reach this point in the Tartarus Questline, go into the dungeon, ignore all quest prompts and go to the end of the cave and defeat Brogos. Then repeat this process. It provides two very strong summons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brain Thief Loop:</strong> You can get this ring from the Moo Manchu and Nefarious Five fights in the Tower of Moo Manchu. For more info, you can visit this page: <a href="Pirate101-Mooshu-Dock-Guide/location pages/subatatempledocks.html">Subata Temple Docks</a> and go to the Tower of Moo Manchu section for more info. This ring is good because it gives another copy of mojo storm, a very high damage aoe dps spell. The other power is also a decent aoe as well.</li>

                    <li><strong>Witchdoctor Pet:</strong> Any pet will do. What matters is what grants it gives you. You really want a pet that provides readied spell to reach readied spell 5 to complete this build. Rainbow blessing is also helpful for the heal and assortment of buffs to the team. Witchhunter is good to have as well to reduce spell damage and deal damage to spellcasting enemies yourself. If you can get elusive, that is good too for bonus dodge.</li>

      <h2 class="section-header1">Power Ordering</h2>
      <div class="image-pair">
        <img src="images/witchdoctorpowerordering.png" alt="Witchdoctor Power Ordering" class="rounded-img">
      </div>
      <p>This is what I personally have my power ordering as. Charm, blood flames, and the gorgon summon have priority because they have good value even on first turn when you haven't gotten any mojo buffs from Old Scratch. I believe Old Scratch is a must-use companion for witchdoctor, and I will explain more about him below in the companions section. Next in priority comes the mojo storm cards, because they are the highest damage aoe dps powers you have. Then, next in priority comes mojo javelin, because it is the strongest single target damaging power witchdoctor has. You can then put more situational powers like mojo blizzard, big guns, soul extraction, etc. After that, I have healing and defensive powers which are later in priority because you likely won't need them on turn 1 when everyone is alive and healthy. Mournsong is another good single target aoe if you can't use mojo javelin, so it is next. The summon jelly polyp is useful so it can be on the front page of powers. Mojo reaver is just the melee version of mojo javelin, but enemies will not often be right next to you, especially if you have readied spell 5, so it is lower in priority. The Ougun's Blessing is strong, but it only grants your own pirate invulnerability to physical attacks, and witchdoctor is pretty reliant on its companions to do well, so it is lower in priority for me.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Companion Setup</h2>
      <p>The playstyle here is to use scratch's mojo buffs ASAP, starting with the strongest ones first, and razing enemies with aoe dps powers they cannot counter.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I believe Old Scratch is a must-use companion for witchdoctor. Witchdoctor's offensive potential is almost entirely based on spells, especially with this build. Old Scratch is the only companion that can directly and very powerfully buff your spell power. I recommend witch hunter 3 for the big mojo scaling attack and the huge resistance to spells. The other epic choices are more flexible and up to you. I recommend mojo echo 3 so scratch can chain if he has nothing else to do. Spooky 4 and Will 4 are important to boost his spell damage while Tough 4 and Dodgy 4 help him with survivability, since he is a valuable unit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content2">
                <h2 class="section-header">Bat Masterson (secondmate)</h2>

                </div>
                <p>Bat Masterson is an excellent power-based aoe dps unit. I recommend running vengeance 3 and hold the line 3. The hold the line will interrupt enemies and reduce their dodge, allowing Bat Masterson to hit his vengeance strikes, which have a chance to stop offensive enemy chains. Running relentless 2 can make bat chain on enemies that hit him quite well. Spooky 4 and Will 4 are important for his spell damage, while tough 4 and dodgy 4 help with survivability, so he can survive to cast more dps aoe spells. Accuracy helps with hitting his vengeance strikes to stop enemy chains.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I recommend hold the line 2 to help interrupt enemy movement and stop them from attacking. Witchhunter can deal heavy damage when activated if you run it. I recommend bladestorm 2 for chaining potential and second chance for if she misses. The last epic is more up to your own discretion. Spooky 4 is important for spell damage. Tough 4 and dodgy 4 are great for survivability so she can survive to cast more powers. The other talents are more up to your own discretion, since gracie cannot crit her powers, so will 4 will not impact her powers.</p>

                <p>You can get spooky ranks 1 and 2 from the Commodore in the Privateer's Office in Avery's Court (Skull Island -> Avery's Court -> Privateer's Office). These powers are great defensively, and witchdoctor lacks defensive powers, so these are good. The will buff also doesn't hurt. More important are elusive 2 and tough 2, which help increase witchdoctor's survivability without even using a power. If you are running the Clasp of the Mourning Queen, you probably don't need the defensive powers as much, but I would still recommend getting elusive 2 and tough 2, which basically requires you to train most everything from the Commodore as prerequisites to get anyways.</p>

                <p>You get these trainables from Kurotadori, a clandestine trainer in Devilfish Hollow under a trapdoor shown on the map (Skull Island -> Corsair's Channel -> Devilfish Hollow -> Clandestine Cave). The trainer under the trapdoor will not always be Kurotadori. It will alternate between clandestine trainers hourly, so be sure to leave a mark and check each hour. Witch hunter is a great epic to train. Readied spell ranks 1 and 2 are required to reach readied spell 5 with this build to push back melee enemies.</p>
