                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dutchman's Inflated Hat:</strong> You can get the dutchman's inflated hat from the Obsidian Floating Dutchman key fight in the Vortex of the Soul (Monquista -> Tierra Primata Skyway -> Vortex of the Soul). This hat is good because it gives Privateer access to the tempest power, which does great aoe damage and sets up damaging traps also do great damage and can interrupt enemy movement. If you run this, you will want to run the Conqueroo's Outfit for your robe, which comes only from the Hoodoo Bundle, which you have to purchase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prefect Josapat's Turban:</strong> You can get the prefect josapat's turban from the Mirage Housing Gauntlet's last fight. Try joining the pirate101 discord <a href="https://discord.com/invite/pirate101" target="_blank"><img src="images/discordicon.png" alt="Discord" class="small-img3"></a> to help find people who are willing to provide this gauntlet for farming. This provides good stats but we mainly use it for the readied spell, because we want readied spell 5 in this build to push away enemies that get too close. If you run this hat, you will probably want to run Captain Blood's Obisidian Jacket as your robe.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Captain Blood's Obsidian Jacket:</strong> You can get the obsidian blood jacket from the Obsidian Blood fight, which you can find in the Scrimshaw Docks at a roomless door with a sigil. Inside will be several obsidian key unlockable fights; you are looking for the one with Captain Blood next to it (Skull Island -> Scrimshaw Docks -> Nightmare Captain Blood Room). This robe is good because of the power, blood flames, which sets 5 fires in a pattern that deal high damage to any enemy that ends up next to them. If you run this robe, you probably want to run Prefect Josapat's Turban as your hat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conqueroo's Outfit:</strong> This item must be obtained by purchasing the Hoodoo Bundle. We run this robe for the readied spell which can get you to readied spell 5 to push away enemies. If you run this robe, you probably want to run Dutchman's Inflated Hat.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Underworld Warlord's Boots:</strong> These boots are important because they provide good stats. The accuracy is especially important because it helps with hitting your readied spell 5. It provides another copy of an aoe heal privateer already has, which can be nice.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sinbad's Mojo Shooter:</strong> You can get this weapon from the final fight of Tamagayoki Tower (Mooshu -> Ravaged Valley -> Tamagayoki Tower). You will need to have completed the sinbad part 1 and 2 questlines to access this tower. This weapon has the right typing of shooty/staffy, which allows you to use readied spell 5 and overwatch 3. It also has an amazing power, which will heal all allies, then heal them again for the same amount at the end of the round for 3 rounds. It is difficult to die or lose companions with this power in your arsenal.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sinbad's Heroic Stripes:</strong> You can get this accessory from various battles in the Tamagayoki Tower (Mooshu -> Ravaged Valley -> Tamagayoki Tower). You will need to have completed the sinbad part 1 and 2 questlines to access this tower. We use this accessory for the amazing power, which puts a shield on all allies, which absorbs a certain amount of damage. It excels when you have more than one Old Scratch companion buffing mojo, making the shield extremely large.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Queen's Vigilant Piece:</strong> You get this totem from Tybalt, a field boss in Trianon from Valencia Part 3. You will need to have completed all story content to access this fight. You can get to Trianon from a chest in Florenza docks in Valencia, which you can transportalate to. This totem is good for the readied spell to contribute to reaching readied spell 5. The spell summons a helpful spell-casting minion, but it only has 1 health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sinbad's Gold Trinket:</strong> You can get this accessory from various battles in the Tamagayoki Tower (Mooshu -> Ravaged Valley -> Tamagayoki Tower). You will need to have completed the sinbad part 1 and 2 questlines to access this tower. This totem is good for the readied spell to reach readied spell 5 as well. The power is good for high single target damage if an enemy is next to you.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right Hand Strand:</strong> You can get this charm from the Moo Manchu and Nefarious Five fights in the Tower of Moo Manchu. For more info, you can visit this page: <a href="Pirate101-Mooshu-Dock-Guide/location pages/subatatempledocks.html">Subata Temple Docks</a> and go to the Tower of Moo Manchu section for more info. We use this charm for the powers; we mainly want the copy of big guns, which is a great damaging aoe.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gorgon's Petrified Band:</strong> You can get this from Chief Brogos in the Cave of Furstrygoneans in Achaea (Aquila -> Achaea -> Cave of Furstrygoneans). You will need to have reached this dungeon in the Tartarus questline to access it. Unfortunately, this dungeon can become inaccessible after completing the story quest that leads to this dungeon. To farm it, use a character that can reach this point in the Tartarus Questline, go into the dungeon, ignore all quest prompts and go to the end of the cave and defeat Brogos. Then repeat this process.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privateer Pet:</strong> Any pet will do. What matters is what grants it gives you. You really want a pet that provides readied spell to reach readied spell 5 to complete this build. It is very helpful if it provides overwatch to reach overwatch 3 for its accuracy debuff as well. Rainbow blessing is also helpful for the heal and assortment of buffs to the team. Witchhunter is good to have as well to reduce spell damage and deal damage to spellcasting enemies yourself. If you can get elusive, that is good too for bonus dodge.</li>
                </ul>

      </div>
      <p>The battle zeal goes up top because it increases accuracy, which can help you hit your readied spell 5, so melee enemies can't reach your team. It can afford to be a little lower if you run the Prefect Josapat's Turban, which gives extra accuracy. The crit buff and the gorgons can be used first turn, when there is no better powers to use in the situation, or your mojo buffs from scratch have run out. I feel Old Scratch is a must-use companion for privateer and I will explain why in the next section.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Companion Setup 1 (Requires Crowns)</h2>
      <p>The playstyle here is to use scratch's mojo buffs ASAP, starting with the strongest ones first, and razing enemies with aoe dps powers they cannot counter.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I recommend witch hunter 3 for the big mojo scaling attack and the huge resistance to spells. The other epic choices are more flexible and up to you. I recommend mojo echo 3 so scratch can chain if he has nothing else to do. Spooky 4 and Will 4 are important to boost his spell damage while Tough 4 and Dodgy 4 help him with survivability, since he is a valuable unit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content2">
                <h2 class="section-header">Bat Masterson (secondmate)</h2>

                </div>
                <p>Bat Masterson is an excellent power-based aoe dps unit, but you will need to buy him from the crowns shop. I recommend running vengeance 3 and hold the line 3. The hold the line will interrupt enemies and reduce their dodge, allowing Bat Masterson to hit his vengeance strikes, which have a chance to stop offensive enemy chains. Running relentless 2 can make bat chain on enemies that hit him quite well. Spooky 4 and Will 4 are important for his spell damage, while tough 4 and dodgy 4 help with survivability, so he can survive to cast more dps aoe spells. Accuracy helps with hitting his vengeance strikes to stop enemy chains.</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>I recommend hold the line 2 to help interrupt enemy movement and stop them from attacking. Witchhunter can deal heavy damage when activated if you run it. I recommend bladestorm 2 for chaining potential and second chance for if she misses. The last epic is more up to your own discretion. Spooky 4 is important for spell damage. Tough 4 and dodgy 4 are great for survivability so she can survive to cast more powers. The other talents are more up to your own discretion, since gracie cannot crit her powers, so will 4 will not impact her powers.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Companion Setup 2 (Free to Play)</h2>
      <p>The playstyle is to use all kinds of buffs on your companions to keep them chaining and alive to kill enemies one by one while scratch buffs your mojo with his powers so you can heal or shield them when necessary. If you use this setup, you will want to move will buffs up towards the top of your power ordering. Old Scratch should probably always be used, but the other companions are interchangeable.</p>

                <p>I recommend repel boarders 3 for the debuff on enemies. Blade storm and relentless 2 are important to keep her chaining dps on enemies. For her last epic, I recommend either vengeance strike or witch hunter for damage. She has a great will buff power too. For talents, any combination of rough, tough, accurate, dodgy, and spirited should be good for chaining and survivability.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I recommend true grit 3 for a chance to stun musket enemies. Overwatch 3 is great to debuff melee enemies. Witchhunter is good to deal heavy damage to spellcasters and have emmett take reduced damage from spells. Emmett is a great utility unit, with very useful utility epics, an aoe heal, and a big -50% damage debuff crit strike. For talents, any combination of rough, tough, accurate, dodgy, and spirited should be good for attacking and survivability.</p>

                <p>For epics, I recommend repel boarders 3 for the enemy debuff. Blade storm 5 is super great for escalating damage with each crit and for chaining. Relentless 2 is also crucial for continuing chains. Turn the Tide 2 is helpful for the bonus stats it provides. For talents, any combination of rough, tough, accurate, dodgy, and spirited should be good for chaining and survivability.</p>

                <p>You can get spooky ranks 1 and 2 from Vadima in the Witchdoctor's Sanctum in Avery's Court (Skull Island -> Avery's Court -> Witchdoctor's Sanctum). The spooky boosts the potency of your powers, which is mostly what a Privateer will be using.</p>

                <p>You get these trainables from Kurotadori, a clandestine trainer in Devilfish Hollow under a trapdoor shown on the map (Skull Island -> Corsair's Channel -> Devilfish Hollow -> Clandestine Cave). The trainer under the trapdoor will not always be Kurotadori. It will alternate between clandestine trainers hourly, so be sure to leave a mark and check each hour. Witch hunter is a great epic to train. Readied spell ranks 1 and 2 are required to reach readied spell 5 with this build to push back melee enemies.</p>

Overwatch ranks 1 and 2 are good to reach overwatch 3, which will put an accuracy debuff on enemies when they are hit with overwatch. If you have extra points, you can train burst fire for a little extra chaining damage.</p>
